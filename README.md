## Updating the Egg

When a new version of the egg is released, follow these steps to update:

### Pelican Panel

**Important:** Pelican cannot update eggs that have active servers. Choose one of these methods:

#### Method 1: Full Reinstall

2. **Delete all servers** using the Hytale egg
3. **Delete the old egg** from **Admin Panel** > **Eggs**
4. Download the latest [egg-hytale.pelican.json](egg-hytale.pelican.json) file from this repository
5. **Import the new egg** via **Admin Panel** > **Eggs** > **Import**
6. **Recreate your servers** and restore your backed-up files

#### Method 2: Manual Update (Advanced)

1. Download the latest [egg-hytale.pelican.json](egg-hytale.pelican.json) file
2. Open both the new egg file and your current egg in a text editor
3. Compare the files and manually copy changes to your egg:
   - Navigate to **Admin Panel** > **Eggs** > Click on the Hytale egg
   - Update **Docker Images**, **Startup Command**, **Configuration Files**, and **Variables** sections
   - Pay special attention to new variables or changed default values
4. Save changes and restart your servers

> **Note:** Method 2 requires careful attention to avoid configuration errors. Always backup before making changes.

### First-Time Authentication

During the first start, the Hytale downloader will require authentication with your Hytale account. You'll see output similar to this in the console:

> [!CAUTION]
> **You must have purchased Hytale on the account you are using to authenticate.**

```txt
Please visit the following URL to authenticate:
https://oauth.accounts.hytale.com/oauth2/device/verify?user_code=XXXXXXXX
Or visit the following URL and enter the code:
https://oauth.accounts.hytale.com/oauth2/device/verify
Authorization code: XXXXXXXX
```

**To complete authentication:**

1. Open the provided URL in your web browser
2. Enter the authorization code shown in the console
3. Sign in with your Hytale account credentials
4. Authorize the server to download game files
5. Return to the console - the download will continue automatically

This authentication step is only required during initial setup. Subsequent server starts will not require re-authentication.
